	Key points : Ms leung or Whomever is marking this, PLEASE READ THIS FIRST
		when assigning a variable, I'm also declaring it as well eg. int a = sc.nextInt(); <- this declares and assigns a value 
		to the variable at the same time
		I tried to explain loops best as i can
		I hope my algorithms are clear and straigh forward enough

	/**
		Question 1
			- prompt user for the number of bars
			- get the number of bars and store it in a Integer variable called num_of_bars
			- print "The Cost of The Purchase is $ " + 2 * num_of_bars
		Question 2
			- prompt user for the length
			- get length and store it in a Integer variable called length
			- prompt user for the width
			- get width and store it in a Integer variable called width
			- if length * width is smaller than or equal to 100
				print "The cost is $ " + length*width*12
			- else
				print "The cost is $ " + length*width*10
		Question 3
			- while ( there's still more users ) 
				- prompt the user for the year that they were born in
				- get the year and store it in a Integer variable called year
				- print "You are " + (2018 - year) + " years old"
				- print "You will be " + (2020 - year) + " years old in 2020"
		Question 4
			- prompt user for the radius of the circle
			- get the radius and store it in a double variable called radius
			- print "The area of the circle is: " + radius*radius*PI 
		Question 5
			- For ( Integer i equals to 2, i is smaller than or equal to 100 , i adds 2 each time )
					- print i
		Question 6
			- declare a double variable called sum and assign a value of 0 to it
		 	- For (Integers i equals to 0 , i is smaller than or equal to 25 , i adds 1 each time )
		 			- sum adds the inputed number
		 	- sum = sum divided by 25
		 	print "The average on the exam was: " + sum
		Question 7
			- prompt user for a number
			- get the number and store it in a Integer variable called number
			- if the number % by 2 equals 0 or is Even
				- print number + " is Even"
			- else 
				- print number + " is Odd"
		Question 8
			while ( the end command is inputed )
				- prompt user for a number
				- get the number and store it in a Integer variable called number 
				- if the number % by 2 equals 0 or is Even
					- print number + " is Even"
				- else 
					- print number + " is Odd"
